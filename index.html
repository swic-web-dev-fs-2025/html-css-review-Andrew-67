  <h2>Reflection Question</h2>
  <ol tpye="1">
    <br> 
    <li> The reason that modules will become more important as the project gets bigger and bigger is so that when you have a hundreds of code lines,
         it would take you longer than you need to to locate the section you are needing to alter. By using modules, you can group certain code types
         together and have them all stored on a single module for convinence. 
    </li>
    <br> 
    <li> The main difference between them is that a default export is defined before adding in the export line, so that you can group types together
         for what you are needing to move over, which for most times, is when needing to send the same data to different modules. Times that you 
         would need to use a name export could be when you are only wanting the data types of only one function.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> The main time you would want to rename an import could be when you are needing to port data from multiple types across different modules,
         but that data could end up getting group into a type you do not want. So by renameing them, you can keep them seperate and prevent them from getting mixed up.
    </li>
